      <h1>SKARLET</h1>
      <h3>By Aaron Dela Cruz in 2022</h3>
      <p> I really like art especially pixel art. I always enjoy looking at the process when it comes to making art and what inspired me to make this porject is pretty interesting. I got my inspiration from r/place which reddit users can place down a pixel every couple of minutes where communities would make art pieces together. At the end of r/place, there is always a timelapse of the whole canvas and I really love that feature. I wanted to use pixel art I already made and use different codes to change the image in a way. I also got the name skarlet from a webtoon I am currently reading.<br>
          <br>
          Here are the works that I have made!</br>
